# InfoSync-AI-Web-Scraper
InfoSync AI Web Scraper is an intelligent, full-stack news aggregation platform 
that intelligently combines multiple data sources to deliver comprehensive news 
analysis. The system scrapes content from Google News and Reddit using advanced 
web scraping techniques, then employs artificial intelligence to synthesize and 
summarize the information into professional-quality content.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
The platform automates the entire news gathering workflow. It uses BeautifulSoup 
and PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) for intelligent web scraping, collecting 
real-time news headlines and community discussions. The aggregated data flows 
through Ollama (Llama 3.2) for AI-powered content synthesis, creating coherent, 
broadcast-quality summaries. Finally, Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) converts these 
summaries into professional audio files that users can listen to anywhere.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
Built as a modern full-stack application with Streamlit providing an intuitive 
user interface and FastAPI powering a robust backend API. The system implements 
asynchronous processing using Python's asyncio, enabling concurrent data fetching 
from multiple sources without blocking. Rate limiting prevents overwhelming external 
servers, while comprehensive error handling ensures graceful degradation if any 
source becomes unavailable.

KEY FEATURES:
- Multi-source data aggregation (news + social media)
- Intelligent web scraping with error recovery
- AI-powered content synthesis (Ollama Llama 3.2)
- Professional text-to-speech audio generation
- Search history tracking and management
- Modern responsive UI with real-time feedback
- Async/concurrent processing for performance
- Production-ready error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Zero external API key dependencies (local execution)

USE CASES:
Perfect for professionals wanting balanced news perspectives, researchers analyzing 
topic coverage across sources, content creators gathering information efficiently, 
and developers learning full-stack development with AI integration.

PORTFOLIO VALUE:
This project demonstrates expertise in web scraping, API integration, asynchronous 
programming, AI/ML implementation, full-stack development, system design, and 
professional code practices. It's production-ready with proper error handling, 
logging, and architectural patterns.

TECH STACK:
Streamlit, FastAPI, Ollama, BeautifulSoup, PRAW, gTTS, Python asyncio, aiolimiter, 
Pydantic, dotenv

Perfect for portfolio, interviews, and showcasing full-stack capabilities.
